# flutter_unity_widget_example

Demonstrates how to use the flutter_unity_widget plugin.

## Run the sample on Android

  1. Open the `unity` project and build it: Menu -> Flutter -> Export Android
  2. Copy `android/UnityExport/libs/unity-classes.jar` to `android/unity-classes/unity-classes.jar` and overwrite the existing file. You only need to do this each time you use a different Unity version.
